## Introduction to IoT - Lab 12: Collaboration, Troubleshooting, and Debugging

Your instructor has created a broken Arduino project with two separate parts:
- Part 1 - Student 1: Sensor (e.g., photoresistor)
- Part 2 - Student 2: Input device 2 logic (e.g., manual override button)

Each part has intentional issues in separate functions. You and your teammate will:
1. Delegate a part for each student
2. Fix your assigned part on separate branches
3. Test independently on your own Arduino boards
4. Push changes to GitHub
5. Merge the code via Pull Request (PR)
6. Assemble and test the merged system together on a single board
